[XXXX] 1.> make the UI for the app >> set 2 time picker alarm allow user to pick time ;and display that
[XXXX]2.>add the logic that allows the alarm app to launch on activity on the desired time --> see if the time is form today (in int) ; if yes no need for the date picker; just take the start time and end time and convert them in milliseconds and take the frequency in seconds and convert it in the milliseconds and then in a loop add them to the start time and keep calling the set alarm funtion(time in millisecond) 
[XXXX]3.> add the alarm sound to the activity launched and a dismiss button and random sound
[XXXX]3.8.> when alarm comes It does not wake the screen up (add some permission in th receiver)
4.> make a db from which I can store and destroy alarms and a ui too (material Ui)
---------- future implementation
5.> if not able to make store the alarm should probally abort the intent , and for that make a function that can be used when the user tries to delete the alarm

wake alarm 3/4 sec before as we get late
---------------------
alarm should be either repeating (eg. week days eg. S,S,M,T..), ability to add alarm between 2 days a week is cool but not useful-->may be give users ability to 1)set alarm 24 hours in the future or b)b/w 2 times 
----------------------
can also make a feature that allows user to enter date and we set the alarm between to dates (abstract the loop in 2 step) but could have to do it on a bg thread as user can exit the app
---
can add a notification such that we also get an notification when when the activity is running
----
can make a ai driven animation on the alarm theme (integrate spotify, eg black skinhead with lightining )
