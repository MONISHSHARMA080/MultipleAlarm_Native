a) UI Refactor : --
    * haptic feedback
    * weekly repeating alarms (like in alarm clock with circles, s,m,t,w,t,f,s
    * when we click on alarms they should expand and also give me the message and alarm information
    * make the frequency one better, like I can type 0 and it should not have an autistic meltdown
    * stop for 10(prefer)/20 min button that can be used 3 times,
    * a restart for 30 min button, here we can create a temp value or alarm where (alarm was from 2:00--6:00) from now(7:00) to now + 30 min (7:30) , create a new
        alarm instead of making db changes as that will be easier
    * a click on alarm value and edit feature, eg endtime and a time picker appears etc



b) Code Refactor :--
    [X] there are 2 scheduler alarms fn make them into one as there is an abstraction there
        [X] scheduleNextAlarm() could be just in the nextAlarmReceiver
        [X] schedulerMultipleAlarms2 we can make the alarm reset into a alarm data call, move the logic there as this is better for reusability
        [X] restructure scheduleMultipleAlarms2()
    [X] use alarmData or a data class and also reduce the alarmData's size by storing less
    [X] better screen wake up, like check if the screen is on or not first it it is then don't wake it up
    [X] there might be a need to reduce the data stored in the db as we can make fn to get the frequencies, instead of doing 60000* everytime
    [X] assert that the alarm is set just to be sure, after setting the alarm via Intent matching
    [X] use results in all the alarms and not the ?Exception
    * write test, for system and alarms using robolectric
    * see and check that the app works for the minimum android version to latest (search for people using android version, go for 50% or > , android 11 or up hopefully)
    * replace the start activity with live notification or foreground activity, ask user [LATER after mvp]
    * also add force update the app , or ask user to update the app



c)  later :--
       [X] abandon or work on multiple dates alarm, eg start form  today 9:00Pm to tomorrow 4:00 Am -- decided not to
       -- try adding the set same alarm on multiple week days form click like stock clock
       -- can't use my alarms as they are copyrighted, would need to use the alarms present in the system

d) Publishing
    * check for the restriction,
        -- app should launch a notification with the full screen intent and can't just start a full screen activity [check, got from gemini]
    * have to change the alarm sound, should be using the system's alarm clock sound
    * Initial screen when fetching the alarms
    * maybe a initial signup screen, like ask user what are they using the app for , and how can we help them, productivity, distracton, Alarm
        or all, explain them how can we help, maybe a/b test this
    * ask users for review on play store helps to boost app
    * analytics -- try post-hog or google ad mob
    * app permissions and justification screen, like I would need to tell the user to give me the notification and bg autostart permission
      and explain why I need it, and also check the actual permission in the app and not just some db field, like notification etc in seperate coro
      as if user or system revoked it we would no be able to display the alarm

e) after mvp --
    * maybe like slice like reward points and  spend points for using the app, watch ads or pay to get more pionts, full 8 months version also
    * a/b test the intrusive ads, and clutter free ads version, (like ads after every click , and point based one), if have more than 1000 users,
        -- see the retention etc, and see what type of users are willing to watch the ads
        there should be a way to a/b test this on some users based on their profiles etc
    * launch adds or play store and try to put it on top of search result
