a) UI Refactor : --
    * haptic feedback
    * weekly repeating alarms (like in alarm clock with circles, s,m,t,w,t,f,s
    * when we click on alarms they should expand and also give me the message and alarm information
    * make the frequency one better, like I can type 0 and it should not have an autistic meltdown
    * stop for 10(prefer)/20 min button that can be used 3 times,
    * a restart for 30 min button, here we can create a temp value or alarm where (alarm was from 2:00--6:00) from now(7:00) to now + 30 min (7:30) , create a new
        alarm instead of making db changes as that will be easier
    * a click on alarm value and edit feature, eg endtime and a time picker appears etc



b) Code Refactor :--
    * there are 2 scheduler alarms fn make them into one as there is an abstraction there
        [X] scheduleNextAlarm() could be just in the nextAlarmReceiver
        [X] schedulerMultipleAlarms2 we can make the alarm reset into a alarm data call, move the logic there as
            this is better for reusability
        -- restructure scheduleMultipleAlarms2()
    * use alarmData or a data class and also reduce the alarmData's size by storing less
    * there might be a need to reduce the data stored in the db as we can make fn to get the frequencies, instead of doing 60000* everytime
    * assert that the alarm is set just to be sure, after setting the alarm via Intent matching
   [X] use results in all the alarms and not the ?Exception
    * write test, for system and alarms using robolectric



c) later: abandon or work on multiple dates alarm, eg start form  today 9:00Pm to tomorrow 4:00 Am
